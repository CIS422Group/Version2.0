There should be an app called GUI.app in the GUI directory, and you can double click
the app to open it.


TO COMPILE THE APP:
1. Make sure to download version 0.13 of py2app by entering the following to the terminal:

            pip install py2app==0.13

   Note: the latest version (0.20) will not compile the code correctly.

2. To change the python file that the app compiles, in setup.py, change the name

            APP = ['GUI.py']    to     APP = ['<filename.py>']

3. Run the 'compile' executable (python3 setup.py py2app). This will create two folders: build and dist.The app should be located inside the 'dist' folder.
